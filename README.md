# multilabel_classification_of_laws

Preprocessing .xml files. Enumerating various vectorizers, including **transformers**. Selecting the best model, selecting the most suitable hyperparameters. Selecting the optimal vector dimension using the principal component analysis method. Creating and training a neural network for the **multilabel_classification_of_laws** problem, vectorizing additional features such as **"Organ"**, **"Name"**, the main feature **"Text"**, using a Bayesian optimizer to select hyperparameters. Checking the output labels and solving the problem of class imbalance.
